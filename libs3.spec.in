%description
This package includes the libs3 shared object library, needed to run
applications compiled against libs3, and additionally contains the s3
utility for accessing Amazon S3.

Group: Development/Libraries
Requires: %{name} = %{version}-%{release}

%description devel
This library provides an API for using Amazon's S3 service (see
http://s3.amazonaws.com).  Its design goals are:

 - To provide a simple and straightforward API for accessing all of S3's
   functionality
 - To not require the developer using libs3 to need to know anything about:
     - HTTP
     - XML
     - SSL
   In other words, this API is meant to stand on its own, without requiring
   any implicit knowledge of how S3 services are accessed using HTTP
   protocols.
 - To be usable from multithreaded code
 - To be usable by code which wants to process multiple S3 requests
   simultaneously from a single thread
 - To be usable in the simple, straightforward way using sequentialized
   blocking requests
