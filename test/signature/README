This is a simple tool to test the libs3 signature against the AWS signature
version 4 test-suite.

You should modify src/request.c to #define S3_SERVICE "service"
and re-build the libs3

And you should download the test-suite from http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-v4-test-suite.html and then unzip it somewhere.

Then you can run the test by
./run.sh /path/to/aws-testsuite/
